# Processing.py sketches

**Processing** is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.

**Processing.py** is a mode derived of *processing*, wich is originally heavily inspired by the *java* programming language, to allow for a syntax close to the *python* one.

The sketches present in this sub-repository are sketches with various different natures, but all of them are related to graphics and physics simulation.

## Installation

To run these programms, you'll need to *install Processing* onto your system and then *download the python extension*.

**Note** : these sketches are written with processing 3
