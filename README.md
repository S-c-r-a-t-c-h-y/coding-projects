## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a french student currently in 12th grade at `LycÃ©e Anna de Noailles` planning to jump into computer science next year !
Coding is a passion I got about one and a half year ago, and since then I experimented with many different languages and other things like the Unity Engine.



## ðŸ›  Skills
Mostly python, but I a also familiar with processing and its javascript homolog the p5.js library.
I also worked a bit with the Unity Engine and C# but I would not consider it as a skill.
