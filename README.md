## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a french student currently in first year of college at `LycÃ©e Champollion`.
Coding is a passion I got about three years ago, and since then I experimented with many different languages and other things like the Unity Engine.


## ðŸ›  Skills
Mostly Python, OCaml and C but I am also familiar with Processing and its Javascript homolog the p5.js library.
I also worked a bit with the Unity Engine and C# but I would not consider it as a skill.
